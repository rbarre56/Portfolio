        I'm Renato Barrera, a Computer Engineer graduate who is interested in all subjects of tech. 
        My main interests are in frontend development, backend development, networking, and UX/UI, 
        though I also enjoy working with databases and data science. Continue scrolling to learn a

    <h2> Skills </h2>

    <h2> REU Experience </h2>
    <p> Back in the summer of 2021, I had the chance to join a new research experience 
        with the ATOC group at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU). With the help of 
        an amazing mentor, I worked on a project to view the trends of the Sun's incoming 
        radiation and its effects on the Arctic ice. At the end of the research experience,
        I summarized my journey and findings in a poster, which I've linked to this site as 
        well. Some of the technologies used included Python, Matplotlib, Pandas, Mac command 
        line, and Jupyter notebook.

    <h2> Steam App Redesign </h2>
    <p> For our UX/UI project, I grouped with 3 others in order to redesign the less than
        stellar Steam app at the time. We went through the entire makeover progress which 
        included performing a user journey to find issues, brainstorming solutions, interviewing
        current users, sketching possible designs, and ultimately creating the prototype on Figma.
        I learned a great deal about Figma and its tools, and I improved my designing, interviewing, 
        and teamwork skills.
